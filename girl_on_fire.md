# Welcome to the Capitol's Annual Hunger Games!

The nation of Panem is divided into 14 "districts". Except for the district known as "The Capitol," each district* is called by its number: Districts 1 through 13. District 13 is, as far as Panem is concerned, destroyed and empty.

Every year the leaders of Panem (all in the Capitol) receive two tributes, one male and one female, from each of the 12 populated Districts. During the event known as The Hunger Games, these tributes fight each other to the death. The single living "victor" then joins an elite class among the citizenry of Panem and brings honor to their District.

Tributes are designated during an event known as the "Reaping." They must be between 12 and 18 years old. There is only one tribute allowed of each gender per District, per year. Ideally, a tribute will volunteer. In the case that none volunteer, they will be chosen at random.**

After the Reaping, tributes are assigned "escorts" (one per District, ie thier tributes share an escort), and proceed to the Capitol for training. During the training the tributes acquire skills and receive a rating. They are also feted and styled. They become celebrities.

The Games are run by Gamemakers, led by their Game Master. The Game master crafts an arena and runs the course of the Game (in a sense, they produce it as a television event).

During the Games the tributes come in to contact in the arena and fight to the death. At the end of every day (referred to as a "round" by the Gamemakers) a cannon is fired and the deaths of tributes from the preceding round are announced.***

Escorts, during the game, attempt to rally sponsors to support their tributes. If a tribute has sponsors, it is more likely that they will survive any given round.

There can be only one victor, and there MUST be a victor.****

**May the odds be ever in your favor... Let the Hunger Games commence!**

#### Addendum on the Reaping

The action of the Reaping will occur as thus:

Simple Version:

1. Tributes (one male and one female) are selected at random(no tesserae) from the people in each district who are aged 12-18
2. Tributes are named, given their escort, and sent to the Capitol

Complex Version:

1. Volunteers are called for
  * if there are no volunteers, pick from the populace at "random", ie based on their tesserae
    * if there are any drafted tributes, there is one last chance for volunteers to take their place
2. Tributes are named, given their escort, and sent to the Capitol
5. Tesserae are distributed for next year's Reaping

#### Addendum on death and destruction

The action of the Games will occur as thus:

Simple Version:

1. The round begins
2. If it is round 1 or 2, the tributes are paired at random and the tribute with the higher rating survives.
  * in the event of a tie, the tribute with more sponsors wins
  * if there is a tie in terms of sponsors, the tribute from the lower-numbered district survives
  * if there is a tie in the district number as well, the female wins
3. If it is round 3, there are three tributes remaining. The tribute with the most sponsors survives.
  * if there is a tie in terms of sponsors, the tribute from the lower-numbered district survives
  * if there is a tie in the district number as well, the female wins
4. The round ends. If it is not the final round, deaths are announced; otherwise a "victor" is named.

Complex Version:

1. The round begins
2. Tributes are assigned to zones
3. Only the tribute(s) with the highest rating will survive in a zone with more than one tribute
  * in the event of a tie, if the tie is between two tributes of the same district they both survive -- otherwise the one with more sponsors survives alone
    * if the ratings and number of sponsors are tied, the tribute from the District with the lower number will survive
  * if there are two tributes from the same District in a zone, each of their ratings is equal to the sum of their individual ratings for that round (eg: Rue (D11) and Thresh (D11) are both in Zone A; Rue (D11) has a rating of 3, and Thresh (D11) has a rating of 7; also in Zone A are Marvel (D1), rating of 8 and Clove (D2), rating of 9 -- Rue and Thresh, for all calculations, will then have a combined rating of 10, and thus both survive/murder the other children)
4. In a zone with only one tribute, the tribute has a 50% chance of survival. For every sponsor (with a maximum of four), this chance is increased by 10%.
5. The round ends. If it is not the final round, deaths are announced; otherwise a "victor" is named.
